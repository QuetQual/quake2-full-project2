Story:
You are a very not penguin shaped penguin with a gun for no particular 
reason and your single goal in life is to fly.
or at the very least feel like you can fly for a short moment before you 
plummet back down to the suprisingly no soft ground.
And the best way to feel like you are flying is to eliminate your enemies and get a really high score.

How to make the mod work:
- 
Download the folder (quakemodded) and put it in your steamapps/common/Quake2 folder and then
launch Original quake (not the rerelease) and press ~ to open the console enter

	set game quakemodded

No matter what I do I can't get the quake non-remaster to work through a shortcut.
